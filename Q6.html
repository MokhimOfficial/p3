The pineapple[2][3] (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible
fruit; it is the most
economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.The pineapple is
indigenous to South
America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction
of the pineapple to
Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury.
Since the 1820s, pineapple
has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical
plantations...</p>
